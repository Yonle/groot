If you want to contribute, then go.
If you don't want, then fine. You do not need to "AARGGH THIS IS SLOW, YOU SHOULD NOT USE IT" or some of childish behavior in anywhere. That just makes you look like a children for other people eyes.

You can contribute by doing:
- Reporting Issues
- Opening Pull request
- Improving repo script (in repo branch)

If you want to contribute, Just contribute as you can.
But not by being shit like only focusing in your opinion.

Remember that this is a personal project. So you shall not:

- Mad to me because i don't accept some of features that you request
- Childish behavior in commit, pull request, or issue message. Like "Please help me", "This does not work", and some of stuff that related to that.

Opening Issues
==============
Do not reporting without telling me what are you doing, or the error log.
This script does not sent any error to me while error occured to you.

Just reporting "i faced some strage behavior", "While i do some stuff, it does not work" without some context does not makes me understand what are you doing in anyway.

Improving Repo script
=====================
The repo plugins/scripts file ONLY allows a independent Distribution.
We do NOT accept a distribution that were based on some major distribution (Ex. Manjaro, Ubuntu).

If you want a distribution like that available on groot, Create your own groot repo. Don't open some of stupid issues.

You SHALL NOT put a nonsenseable script in plugins. 

License
=======
This project is using BSD-3-Clause license and you shouldn't open a Pull request to change it for literally no reason.

Commiting Changes
=================
Before commiting changes, Ensure that everything is completely correctly changed. Commit once you think that everything is correct and there's no mistake.

I also suggest commiting with clear description about what do you change, What does it mean, And what it will do / fix.
